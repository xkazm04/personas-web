 * The atoms this field is assembled from.

 * `Slot` is the important one: a percent-placed box that is MOUNTED FOR THE
 * WHOLE LOOP and wears two skins — a dashed waiting outline and the real
 * thing — crossfading against each other. The box never appears or
 * disappears, so a kept thing coming to rest can never move the anchor its
 * thread is drawn to, which is the whole reason the threads stay attached to
 * what they came out of.
 *
 * `Part` owns the order things arrive INSIDE a stage: the tick clock decides
 * which stage a thing is at, framer decides the cascade within it, and every
 * cascade finishes well inside one 900ms tick.
