# Feature Voting & Comments
> Community "Vote for what's next" section — anonymous one-tap upvotes, Ko-fi-tier boosts, threaded comments, and free-text feature requests, all persisted through four API routes (Supabase in prod, JSON-file fallback in dev). · **API:** `/api/votes`, `/api/feature-requests`, `/api/feature-comments`, `/api/feature-boosts` · **Status:** Live

## What it does
A homepage section (`#vote`) where visitors shape the roadmap without signing in:

- **Vote / unvote** — one tap toggles an upvote on a roadmap feature (`macos`, `i18n`, `dashboard`, `enterprise`). The count updates optimistically and rolls back on API failure. Displayed count = a marketing **seed** (`feature.votes`) + the live API count.
- **Boost** — if a Ko-fi username is configured, each card shows a rocket button opening `$5 / $15 / $25` tiers. Clicking a tier optimistically adds the tier weight to the feature's boost total and opens the Ko-fi page in a new tab. Each voter contributes **one boost per feature** (re-boosting replaces the prior tier, not stacks).
- **Comment threads** — per-feature, collapsible discussion with one level of replies. Author is an auto-generated anonymous handle (e.g. `SwiftFox`). Comments post optimistically.
- **Custom requests** — a free-text box ("Something else in mind?") posts a suggestion (max 1000 chars) with inline success/error/rate-limit feedback.
- **Live summary** — a footer line tallying total votes · comments · boosts · "Live".

## How it works
`FeatureVoting` (`src/components/sections/feature-voting/index.tsx:28`) is the orchestrating Client Component. On mount, `useAbortableEffect` (`index.tsx:36`) mints/reads a localStorage `voterId` (`data.ts:79`) and fires `Promise.allSettled` over `fetchVotes`, `fetchComments`, `fetchBoostTotals` (`index.tsx:41`); each result is applied independently so one failure doesn't blank the others. It owns all server state (`votedIds`, `voteCounts`, `comments`, `boostTotals`) and passes optimistic mutators down.

The three mutations follow the same optimistic shape (`index.tsx:61-149`): update local state immediately, POST via the `data.ts` helper, and on rejection capture to Sentry + revert. Comments use a `pending-…` placeholder id that's swapped for the server row when the POST resolves (`index.tsx:116`).

Each feature renders a `FeatureVoteCard` (`components/FeatureVoteCard.tsx:14`). The card holds its own `voted` toggle and re-syncs it from the parent via the **prev-state reset pattern** (`FeatureVoteCard.tsx:43`, React-19-safe — no `setState` in effect). Cards sort by seed+live total, descending (`index.tsx:152`). Comments expand into a `CommentThread` (`components/CommentThread.tsx:10`) → `CommentBubble` + `CommentInput`; boost UI is `FeatureBoostButton` (`components/FeatureBoostButton.tsx:7`), gated on `showBoostUI={!!KOFI_USERNAME}` (`index.tsx:179`).

**API routes** all share one shape: per-IP in-memory rate limit (`getClientIp` → shared `isRateLimited`), `parseJsonBody` with a byte cap, strict input validation against an `ALLOWED_FEATURES` allowlist, then a Supabase write when `hasSupabaseEnv()` is true, else an atomic JSON-file write (`updateJsonFile` / `withWriteLock`). `/api/votes` POST is a **toggle** — first call inserts, second deletes; a body with `email` instead updates the row for ship notifications (`votes/route.ts:140`).

## Data & state
- **Source:** seed `features[]` in `data.ts:13` (marketing display numbers, **not** stored server-side) merged with live counts from the API. **Stores:** no Zustand — all state is local `useState` in `FeatureVoting`; client identity persists in `localStorage` (`personas-voter-id`, `personas-comment-author`). **API routes:** `GET/POST /api/votes`, `POST /api/feature-requests`, `GET/POST /api/feature-comments`, `GET/POST /api/feature-boosts`. **Types:** `Feature`, `Comment`, `AccentToken` (`local-types.ts`); server `VoteEntry`/`ShippedEntry` (`votes/storage.ts:20`), `CommentRow` (`feature-comments/route.ts:20`), `BoostRow` (`feature-boosts/route.ts:19`).
- **Persistence backend:** Supabase tables `feature_votes`, `feature_comments`, `feature_boosts`, `feature_requests`, `shipped_features` when env is set; otherwise JSON files (`votes.json`, `comments.json`, `boosts.json`, `feature-requests.json`) via the server JSON-file store. The FS path serializes writes (`withWriteLock` / `updateJsonFile`) to avoid TOCTOU.

## Integration points
- **Anonymous identity:** `getOrCreateVoterId` (`data.ts:79`) and `getOrCreateAuthor` (`data.ts:98`) are the only identity source; the same `voterId` keys votes and boosts and must satisfy `isValidVoterId` (`src/lib/validation.ts:33`, `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{16,64}$`).
- **Ko-fi:** `KOFI_USERNAME` (`data.ts:62`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_KOFI_USERNAME`) gates all boost UI and the "Sponsor this request" link; empty = boosts hidden entirely.
- **Analytics:** `trackFeatureVote`, `trackFeatureComment`, `trackFeatureRequest` from `@/lib/analytics` fire on each interaction.
- **Sentry:** every failed mutation is captured with `component`/`action` tags (`index.tsx:76,119,141`); PII scrubbing is handled centrally per CLAUDE.md.
- **Shipped features:** `GET /api/votes` also returns `shipped` (from `shipped_features`); `NotifyInput` exists to collect a ship-notification email but is not wired into the live card (see gotchas).
- **Shared infra:** `apiFetch` (throws on non-2xx), `parseJsonBody`, `getClientIp`, shared rate-limiter, `SectionWrapper` (`#vote` anchor) + `fadeUp`/`staggerContainer` variants.

## Conventions & gotchas
- **Vote integrity is intentionally weak — known limitation.** `voterId` is client-minted and `localStorage`-stored; the server cannot tell a real voter from a script generating fresh IDs. `isValidVoterId` only rejects malformed strings — it is **not** anti-fraud (see the candid comment at `src/lib/validation.ts`). There is no signed-cookie binding and no captcha, so minting fresh IDs still stuffs votes; the documented fix is to bind `voterId` to an HttpOnly HMAC cookie. A `UNIQUE(feature_id, voter_id)` constraint **does** exist (`scripts/setup-voting-db.sql`), and the Supabase insert is an idempotent `upsert … { ignoreDuplicates: true }`, so one voter_id counts at most once per feature and concurrent requests can't double-insert. **Boosts still have no payment verification** — clicking a tier records a boost whether or not the Ko-fi donation completes (real proof needs a signed webhook). Abuse is now *bounded*, not eliminated: `weight`/`tierValue` are pinned server-side to the real tier set `{5, 15, 25}` and boosts upsert one row per `(feature_id, voter_id)`, so a voter can't stack a feature's total — but fresh voterIds can still each add one tier.
- **Rate-limit / XFF spoofing.** Limits are **in-memory per process** (`src/lib/server/rate-limit.ts`) — they reset on deploy and don't share state across serverless instances, so effective limits are higher under scale-out. The IP key comes from `getClientIp` (`src/lib/server/request.ts:30`), which only trusts `req.ip` / `x-vercel-forwarded-for` by default; `x-forwarded-for`/`x-real-ip` are honored **only** when `TRUST_PROXY=true`. If deployed behind a proxy without that flag, requests with no trusted IP source fall back to a **coarse header fingerprint** (`fp:<hash>` of UA + accept headers) so distinct clients land in distinct buckets instead of all sharing one `"unknown"` bucket — best-effort, spoofable, not a trust signal; if `TRUST_PROXY=true` is set in front of an untrusted edge, the leftmost XFF is attacker-controlled and defeats per-IP limiting. IPs are used only transiently and never persisted (per each route's PII header).
- **Client-asserted everything.** `featureId` is allowlisted (`ALLOWED_FEATURES`), and boost `weight`/`tierValue` are now pinned to the allowed tier set, but `author`, comment `text`, and request `text` are still client-supplied and only length/format-validated server-side — no sanitization beyond trimming and a parent-id UUID check. Author handles are not unique or owned, so anyone can post under any handle. Comment/request text is rendered as plain text (React escapes it), but treat it as untrusted user content anywhere it's reused.
- **Optimistic UX can desync.** Counts/boosts/comments mutate before the server confirms and only revert on a thrown error; a silent partial success (e.g. duplicate insert) leaves the UI optimistic. The seed `feature.votes` is added on top of live counts purely for display — don't read the on-screen number as a real tally.
- **Dead/unwired files in this folder.** `CustomRequest.tsx` is a superseded duplicate of `components/CustomFeatureRequest.tsx` (the latter is what `index.tsx` imports — it adds error handling + the Ko-fi link). `NotifyInput.tsx` (ship-notification email) and `VoteParticles.tsx` (vote burst animation) are **not imported anywhere**. Note `VoteParticles` uses `Math.cos`/`Math.sin` math (pure, fine) but if it's ever wired in, its framer-motion animation would need a `useReducedMotion` gate per the repo's animation rule.
- **i18n:** this section is currently hardcoded English (headers, buttons, placeholders, summary copy) and does **not** use `useTranslation()` — a known deviation from the repo's hard i18n rule, like the `/security` page. Treat as debt, not a pattern to copy.
- **React 19 safety:** `FeatureVoteCard` correctly uses the prev-state reset pattern (`:43`) instead of `setState`-in-effect; voterId is mutated through a `ref`, not state.
